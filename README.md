## Current Target of the game

The current target of the game is to create an escape room partitioned into three different levels with a variety of gimmicks that the player must solve to reach the exit. Each subsequent level will have increasing difficulty, a different themed concept (dungeon, jungle, etc), and will use the core elements we implemented of picking up/dropping objects, interacting with keypads, and more puzzles in creative ways to challenge the player’s mind and problem-solving abilities.

## Controls
**Player Movement**
- WASD: Horizontal movement (forward, left, backwards, and right)
- Space bar: Jump

**Camera Movement**
- Camera moves based on cursor movement
- Click screen to lock cursor
- Esc: Unlock cursor
- 1: Switch to first-person mode
- 2: Switch to third-person mode
In first-person mode, point the crosshair and click on the object you intend to pickup. This will make the object freeze in place in front of the character, allowing the player to “hold” it. When an object is held, it will follow the player’s camera movements that are dependent on the mouse input. To drop the object currently held, click again.

## General Goals for each person
**Antonio**
- Write scripts for puzzle systems (locked doors, keys, object triggers, etc).
- Implement puzzle logic and connections between puzzles and room progression.
- Create reusable puzzle prefabs and communicate with level design to place them correctly.
- Handle level design and direction.
- Handle merging teammate contributions in GitHub.

**Simmon**
- Assist in writing scripts & creating game objects for puzzle systems (ordered button activations, hidden keys/objects, hidden passcodes, moving platforms, etc).
- Assist in designing the room layout and platforming segments for each level.
- Test gameplay to ensure puzzles and physics of interactable objects work as intended within each room/level.
- Handle game UI components (level selection screen, countdown timer until game over, etc).

**Deeni**
- Import any wanted art assets into the game as models, props, and environment pieces.
- Set up animations for environmental elements, such as doors, moving objects, and lights.
- Apply visual polish to each room (lighting tweaks, material setup, scene decoration, and environmental effects).
- Help ensure each themed level (jungle, dungeon, scifi, etc.) is cohesive.

**Ryan**
- Implement and manage sound effects and background music.
- Set up audio objects to trigger sound cues for puzzles, doors, buttons, pickups, UI, and other gameplay elements.
- Create an option that allows users to manage the volume of both music and sound effects.
